## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-✔️ Complete each step of the sequence
-✔️ Go back to a previous step to update their selections
-✔️ See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
-✔️ View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-✔️ See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  -✔️ A field has been missed
  -✔️ The email address is not formatted correctly
  -✔️ A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

- Used switch cases for each form(Not all)! Save each input to a locally scoped object, and then push this object into an array which is saved from the local Storage when the form is complete.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I'm getting less and less reliant on ChatGPT, which is a good thing! I'm starting to come up with my own approach to a solution, though I always forget some methods even the simple ones!
